    <!-- Type script basics:

    TypeScript starts with JavaScript and ends with JavaScript.
    Typescript adopts the basic building blocks of your program from JavaScript. 
    Hence, you only need to know JavaScript to use TypeScript. 
    All TypeScript code is converted into its JavaScript equivalent for the purpose of execution. -->
